I'm really passionate about Data and Data Science related areas. I am a recent graduate with Masters of Science in Data Science Degree from Bellevue University. I have learned and explored variety of Data Science topics in my Master's Degree Program. Some of them are Data Visualization with Python and R with variety of visualization libraries and Data story telling through dashboard using Tableau and PowerBI. With the development of technology, I believe that there is a huge potential for Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence in different domains. I have been working in Insurance Industry for the past 7+ years and currently hold Chartered Property and Casualty Underwriter (CPCU) designation. I also hold AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification. The rapid rate of change in insurance industry at which there is advancement in data, computing power, and Cloud computing led me to further advance my knowledge and skillset within Data Science and Cloud computing fields.
